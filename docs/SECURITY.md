3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you
    know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.
4. Once we have either published a fix or declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
